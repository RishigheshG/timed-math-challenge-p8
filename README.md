# Timed Math Challenge using Python
### This is my 8th Project which is part of my 100 Python Projects in 100 Days series

This will randomly generate math questions and not let the user continue until they get the answer correct and we will time how long it takes them to answer all these questions. We use the time and random modules in this project.
